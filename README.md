# boxxes
[abandoned] Boxxes was one of my first projects.

## History
When I created this project I was completely self-taught.

### Purpose
This project was submitted in the house app contest. However, The Nebraska CD-01 representative, Jeff Fortenberry, ghosted the contestants in his district meaning no winner was ever declared.

## Disclaimer
This project is _not_ an example of the quality of my work. This project is made available to reflect on my early days of programming.
